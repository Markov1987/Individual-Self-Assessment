# Individual-Self-Assessment

## Summary of the project

For this final project, we reviewed different basis and discuss to identy and select a topic that may be interesting for all of us, this is why we selected books as a general idea. While reviewing what we learned during the course we tough a way to use the learned models was either to categorize books or to predict something related. 

Categorization was not fully interesting since books got some natural categories such as publisher, author or even books' type category, thus, we prefered to explore the forecasting way. After further review, we noted that some of the variables obtained seemed to naturally be cataloged as dependent and independent variables, for example, is not natural to think that the rating of a book may define the author of that book, but otherwise makes sense. 

Finally, we decided to try all the reviewed models to identify the better one to forecast rating as a a result of the combination of the other variables. When numberes makes sense, we created a history to talk about our project without specifly say that this is an academic project but a real life problem solving.  

##  Self-assessment

I think I supported the team by providing ideas both of which models to use and how to create a history to tell our project. From the technical side, I prepared the code used to prepare the data for the model: Cleaning missing pieces, creating dummys from categorical variables, correcting data types, etc. This helped us to better understand the information and evalute accuretly our results.

I proposed the logistic model due to its simplicity to be explained and because it matches our needs from a theoretical point of view, finally, the results shown it also was the one with better forecasting results.
