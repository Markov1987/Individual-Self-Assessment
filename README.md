# Individual-Self-Assessment

## Summary of the project

For this final project, we reviewed different basis and discuss to identy and select a topic that may be interesting for all of us, this is why we selected books as a general idea. While reviewing what we learned during the course we tough a way to use the learned models was either to categorize books or to predict something related. 

Categorization was not fully interesting since books got some natural categories such as publisher, author or even books' type category, thus, we prefered to explore the forecasting way. After further review, we noted that some of the variables obtained seemed to naturally be cataloged as dependent and independent variables, for example, is not natural to think that the rating of a book may define the author of that book, but otherwise makes sense. 

Finally, we decided to try all the reviewed models to identify the better one to forecast rating as a a result of the combination of the other variables. When numberes makes sense, we created a history to talk about our project without specifly say that this is an academic project but a real life problem solving.  

##  Self-assessment

I think I supported the team by providing ideas both of which models to use and how to create a history to tell our project. From the technical side, I prepared the code used to prepare the data for the model: Cleaning missing pieces, creating dummys from categorical variables, correcting data types, etc. This helped us to better understand the information and evalute accuretly our results.

I proposed the logistic model due to its simplicity to be explained and because it matches our needs from a theoretical point of view, finally, the results shown it also was the one with better forecasting results.

I think effectively performed my duties and supported the team to reach the objectives we defined.  

## Team assessment

We worked pretty good together both during classes and in non-regular hours we scheduled to follow-up on our deliverables on a weekly basis: 

1) Monse prepared the slides and created the identity both for the brand and the client helping us to perform a history showing real application outside of technology industry for our learning. 
2) Francisco worked in the algorith executing the main analysis and also reviewed congruency at the ReadMe file, he made sure that all the changes we worked out during the weeks were included where they needed to so ensure our project . 
3) Fernando reviewed alternative proposals that gave us insights on the analysis and confirmed our election, he also prepared the Dashboard that was really useful to better understand the data. 

As a team, we reviewed the outcomes, we tried different paths, we commented on how we wanted to present the outcomes, proposed roles, define deliverables, and had a great communication all over the process. 

In general, I would say it was pretty easy to work with these guys and we reached all the targets we planned.
